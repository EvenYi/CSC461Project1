45,How To Use Chopsticks - In About A Minute üçú,/watch?v=xFRzzSF_6gk,2018-02-28 07:50:47,"You're most likely sitting in a restaurant with a set of chopsticks in your hand saying ""what do i do with these?""

Some of the videos you watch seem to take forever to learn. This video is all about simplicity.

Although there is a traditional method on how to use chopsticks, this video will show you a simple way to start using them right away. Once you master this simple technique, the traditional method will be a cinch to learn.

Not to mention, you can finally start eating your dinner.

There are many methods, but I have found this one the easiest to learn and with a little practice, you will be a chopsticks master in no time. Good Luck!

2,EGYPT: Vegetarian food | Mobile Sim | Indian Spy !!,/watch?v=Gozaqmg6hmk,2017-08-24 15:34:42,"http://bit.ly/subscribeMT
In this video, you will see me 'hunting' for the best mobile network in Egypt. Based on the feedback from many people I chose to buy Vodafone. The sim cost me 150 LE. There are other mobile networks like Etisalat, Orange (formerly Mobinil) and We (Government owned). Talking about the availability of vegetarian food in Egypt, it is not that difficult as it was for me in most of the South-East Asian countries. I have shared my food expenses in this video. Also, you will see some incidents of tourist hassles. The beginning of the video is about a corrupt practice which I found the hotels do in Egypt.
I have shared some more information here -

72,India's Biggest food FESTIVAL | food truck festival | Jawaharlal nehru stadium | Delhi |,/watch?v=NpOVNb1keoc,2015-11-10 05:27:35,"Alright guys i hope you liked my video.
About
With an aim to find a somewhat solution to this dilemma, a three day food festival titled, ‚ÄòHorn OK Please - Delhi‚Äôs Happiest Food Festival‚Äô was organised by Digant Sharma, founder, So Delhi. ‚ÄúMost food festivals feature eateries and dishes that have skyrocketing prices, and with the 5th edition of the festival, we aim to offer delicious food and more at pocket-friendly prices‚Äù, he says.

This festival was a family-friendly food carnival showcasing 150+ eateries from across the city. However the fest was not just a plethora of food stalls. The festival included a flea market called ‚ÄòQuirk Bazzar‚Äô which featured souvenirs, stationary and apparels. Along with that, the public could have tried their hand VR, Bungee, Bull Riding, Segway & ATV rides in a zone called ‚ÄòExperience Zone‚Äô.
Coming to the food side of the fest, there were food carts and food on wheels also known as food trucks that served food at reasonable rates and food stalls that served items that one could not have even imagined. Whether one wanted to have a simple pizza or one craved a pancake or waffle; if one craved oriental or a simple kathi roll, it was all there.

19,Pondicherry Food Tour - Mutton SAMOSA & PAAYA Soup | Chicken MACRONI | Franco - Tamil Food,/watch?v=j8IRhUUJcSI,2016-01-22 03:44:47,"Another day, another tour. Or trip to Pondicherry was full of new and innovative dishes that were supremely tasty. We went through the streets of Pondicherry and tasted a South Indian style chaat called Verakadala Sundal- made from boiled peanuts mixed with tomatoes, onions and a few spices. This is a burst of flavours in the mouth and is a perfect snack to be chomping on the beach.

We then went to KBS Coffee Bar, but not for coffee. This shop has been around for the longest time and along with serving coffee they also give Chettinad Kuzhi Paniyaram. The Kuzhi Paniyaram is made using rice batter and urad dal which is steamed in small moulds known as Kuzhi. This is then served with a super hot chutney called kaara chutney. Soft, fluffy and perfectly spice the paniyaram is one delightful snack.

Now for some meaty goodness we landed at a cart serving mutton samosa. Here the samosas are filled with a combination of keema or minced mutton, cabbage, onion and quite a few spices. Even better is that they serve Paaya or Leg soup which goes perfectly well with the samosa. People usually dip the deep fried, crispy samosa into the soup and let the flavours do the work.

Next we ended up at Paati Kadai for some good old fried foods. Paati means Granny in Tamil so it is basically like grandma‚Äôs kitchen. Here we tried prawn, fish and chicken bajji. Everything that you get at this little shop is perfectly spiced, fried and served. I mean nothing can go wrong when Grandma is cooking!

Pretty soon we found ourselves in the middle of a war about to breakout or at least that is what it felt like. The huge number of people weighing down this tiny little sop were just there for their chicken macaroni. The macaroni is made with a combination of unique things like noodles, eggs, chicken cooked in south indian spices and curry leaves along with a lot of red chillies and pepper. The flavours of this dish are so distinct that once you;ve had a taste, you cannot stop. For a traditional home cooked meal we went to Puducherry Hotel Sri Kamatchi. We tried the chicken Dosa which is heavily spiced with black pepper and is served with different types of chutney and surprisingly some chicken curry.

The next day, we started our journey with a cup of hot and ultra strong Filter Coffee. The Indian Coffee House is truly about giving you the ultimate coffee experience. Later for a true Franco-Tamil food experience. We visited Maison Perumal to meet Chef Babu who prepared some exquisite dishes just for us. We tried, a simple salad made with chickpeas, some veg and boiled egg whites; prawn cooked in mustard and coconut curry or Kudugu Iral, and finally some Prawn Spinach Soup. Each and every preparation was unique and simply delicious.

you : can take cab for travelling from one point to another , but that's expensive they charge anything from Rs 200 to Rs 400...

Day 1 :
cab : 2500
food 1000
hotel: 1500
Total cost of Day 1: Rs 5000.
Above cost will apply for Day 0 and Day 1 will be 2500 plus 5000 equals to 7500.

I paid much higher cost because i had exclusive taxi all the time, i stayed in 3 category hotel which was expensive.


As always i love to read your comments and reply back on them‚Ä¶ thanks for your time‚Ä¶

KELANTAN, MALAYSIA - If you‚Äôre looking for amazing Malaysian food, Kelantan is a state that‚Äôs unique, cultural, and has some of the best food in Malaysia.

During trips to Kuala Lumpur over the years, I had tried a number of Kelantanese dishes, but that only increased my desire to eventually visit the source, to visit Kelantan, Malaysia. Finally, this was our chance, and we went on a Malaysian food tour of Kelantan, around Kota Bharu.

Here‚Äôs all the amazing food we ate in this video:

Nasi Kerabu Panji - Without a doubt, one of the Malaysian foods you don‚Äôt want to miss when you visit Kelantan is nasi kerabu, rice salad, but it‚Äôs so much more than that. It‚Äôs a breakfast dish and we first started at Nasi Kerabu Panji, a local favorite spot. You get blue rice, topped with salad and side dishes, drizzled in budu fermented fish sauce, and topped with you choice of main mean. It was extraordinary.
Price - About 8 MYR ($1.96) per plate

Jijah's Nasi Kerabu - Since nasi kerabu is one of the top Malaysian foods of the state of Kelantan, we decided to have two nasi kerabu‚Äôs back to back, but totally different styles and even different colors of rice. Jijah's Nasi Kerabu specializes in grilled goat, and it was incredible, highly recommended when you visit Kelantan, Malaysia.
Price - 4.50 MYR ($1.10) per plate

Siti Khadijah Market - One of the top attractions in Kota Bharu is Siti Khadijah Market, a beautiful colorful market where you can buy all the ingredients from Kelantan and there‚Äôs also an amazing cooked food section. Laksam - 3.50 MYR ($0.86) per bowl - I had a bowl of laksam, a Kelantan Malaysian food version of laksa. Akok - 1 MYR ($0.24) for 2 - Later we also tried akok, a popular and local Kelantanese dessert.

D'Umi Nasi Ulam - Another Malaysian food you don‚Äôt want to miss eating in Kelantan is nasi ulam, rice with raw vegetables, and a mix of dishes, all eaten specifically with budu - fermented anchovy sauce. This restaurant was amazing, a huge mix of dishes, friendly owner, and delicious food. Of course, we couldn‚Äôt resist the tempoyak - fermented durian paste.

Kak Jah Ayam Percik Bulatan Lemal - Finally to end this Malaysian street food tour of Kelantan, we had some ayam percik, a coconut milk barbecue sauce dish that originates in Kelantan. We barely arrived in time, but luckily got the last few skewers.
Ayam percik - 16 MYR ($3.93) per big skewer

Kelantan is an amazing state in Malaysia to eat Malaysian street food and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit, the incredible food, and friendly people.

Thank you for watching this Malaysian food video in Kelantan. If you haven‚Äôt already, you can watch the entire series here: https://youtu.be/u5LYl4DM5c4

In this food video travel vlog, I'm (Trevor James, The Food Ranger), bringing you to eat some of the most UNIQUE Chinese noodles!

We're starting the noodle tour in Beijing, China, and enjoying a huge bowl of Beijing Zhajiangmian AKA Beijing Zhajiang noodles, one of the most fragrant and satisfying noodle chews you'll ever experience. AND, we're complimenting that bowl of Beijing noodles with a delicious bowl of pork organ stew, an intense organ aroma stew with chopped intestines and lungs. Delicious!

After traveling to Beijing to eat noodles, we're flying direct into Lanzhou, the home of the world famous muslim Chinese street food. Here, the local Hui chinese cook up some of the best Halal Chinese food in the world, and have a UNIQUE specialty that is worth flying for, the Lanzhou lamian, AKA Lanzhou ramen AKA lanzhou beef noodle soup! WOW! This is one of the BEST noodle dishes you'll ever taste! And watching the extremely tasty Lanzhou noodles being hand pulled is one of the most satisfying things to watch too! The beef noodle soup is made with beef fat and bone and also lots of local radish which gives it an incredibly complex and satisfying aroma to slurp on!! And you can order up as many slices of beef to put on top of your lanzhou noodles as well!

After traveling to Lanzhou, we're flying in to Chengdu to eat Sichuan food and of course, the one and only Sichuan Dan Dan noodles!!! Dan dan noodles or Dandan mian as they are called here in China are one of the most incredibly aromatic and ""Xiang"" bowls of noodles you'll ever experience. The spicy chili oil and the intense pork aroma with a slight earthy kick from pickled mustard greens is truly unlike anything in the whole world. You have to fly here to eat these! They are absolutely incredible! AND, we're topping off the noodles with a nice plump bowl of Hongyouchaoshou AKA Chinese hot chili oil wontons! They burst in your mouth with flavour and chili oil! WOWWW!!! In Chengdu, Sichuan cuisine is at the top of it's game, super flavourful and intense with Sichuan chili and peppercorn, and I definitely recommend flying in to eat it!

After Chengdu dan dan noodles, we're taking a direct flight to Shanghai to eat my personal favourite bowl of noodles in the city, and a bowl that is worth flying in direct to China to eat for, the majiang mian AKA sesame butter noodles. The noodles are full of chili oil and sesame butter mixed together, so you have this EXTREMELY satisfying nutty and spicy combo over top of springy al dente noodles, and, you can top it off with some nice spicy pork chunks! It doesn't get any better than that!! Another BIG WOW!!!

After shanghai, we're finishing this food travel video by flying in direct to Hong Kong, another world famous food destination, to eat some cantonese cuisine and some southern Chinese noodles, the ganchaoniuhe, AKA stir fried chinese rice noodles with tender slices of beef! We're visiting a local daipaidong AKA Chinese street food alley stall that is packed with hungry locals who all love eating tons of delicious Cantonese cuisine and seafood! At this daipaidong, aiwensheng, you can eat a lot of different Chinese seafoods and stir fried cantonese cuisine dishes, but we came in solely to eat the stir fried rice noodles, but we couldn't help ourselves and ordered a mud crab and some fried seafood as well because it looked so good! Another HUGE WOW!! China has some of the best food in the world, and definitely the BEST noodles in the world!!

64,"Top 10 Indian Street Foods in Mumbai, India | The BEST INDIAN Street Food in Mumbai",/watch?v=YBN29Q1xDH8,2015-09-01 03:18:53,"Back in early 2018, I spent three unforgettable weeks traveling through India and exploring its cities and historical sites, immersing myself in the culture, and going on as many street food tours as I possibly could.

I spent three days eating my way through Mumbai, the most populous city in India. In this video, I‚Äôm going to tell you all about the top 10 street foods you have to try when you visit Mumbai. You guys ready? Let‚Äôs do this.

Pani puri, which I first tried at Elco restaurant in the Bandra neighborhood of Mumbai. Panipuri is a round, hollow ball of crispy, fried bread that is punctured and then filled with a soup that can contain chili, tamarind chutney, chaat masala, chickpeas, onion, and potatoes.

Bombay duck, which is a local specialty in Mumbai that I tried at Mata Pita Da Dhaba on Madh Island. Now, you might be surprised to learn that Bombay Duck actually isn‚Äôt duck at all. It‚Äôs a fish that‚Äôs either deep fried or cooked in curry, and cut into strips almost like fish sticks. It‚Äôs soft, lightly battered, and crispy, and kind of reminded me of flounder.

Ice Gola, a cold, sweet, and salty treat made of shaved ice. The vendor molds the ice around a wooden stick and then dips it into a cup that‚Äôs filled with your choice of fruit flavorings. The one I had was blueberry and lemon, which I loved. It made for a unique and delicious combination along with the salt.

Kalidas Masala Vada Pav, a vegetarian Masala burger I tried in the Mulund neighborhood of Mumbai. The burger was made by mixing several ingredients together on a hot pan, including butter, Masala, coriander, and herbs, and cooking it until it reduces into a thick sauce or paste.

Nitrogen Biscuit, which I ate at the Ice Cream Factory, also in the Mulund neighborhood. It‚Äôs a freezing cold biscuit that‚Äôs been dipped in liquid nitrogen. Eating one of these bizarre desserts is a spectacle because as you chew the biscuit, the heat from your mouth turns the liquid nitrogen into a gas, which makes you look like you‚Äôre breathing smoke. My teeth were frozen afterward!

Ice Bhel is a cold, refreshing chaat dish that contains a mouthwatering blend of tomatoes, onions, puffed rice, garlic paste, and coriander. It‚Äôs crunchy and super flavorful, and not spicy at all, and is my favorite thing I tried on my first night in Mumbai.

Paneer Chili, which is a very popular Indo-Chinese dish I tried at Juhu Beach. It is made of cubes of deep fried cottage cheese, Chinese sauces, lots of vegetables including bell pepper and spring onions, chili paste, and a whole lot of deliciousness. I was told it would be really hot, but I didn‚Äôt find it particularly spicy. That said, it is bursting with flavor with every bite, and I cannot recommend it enough.

Chicken Lollipop, which I tried along Mohammad Ali Road. This is a fried chicken drumstick that‚Äôs covered in a red curry that‚Äôs so rich, it actually changes the color of the chicken. When you hold the drumstick upright by the bone, it resembles a lollipop, which is how the dish got its name.

Now, further along Mohammad Ali road, you can find the second-to-last items on this list, mutton and chicken kebabs. Mutton is the meat of a mature sheep, and the most common type of kebab is either meat or vegetables that are speared on a skewer and grilled over a fire. The kebabs I had were made of soft, spicy, minced meat and came with a refreshing salad on the side.

The last food on my list is another I tried along Mohammad Ali Road called Lassi, which is a creamy yogurt drink that was not only refreshing because of the heat in Mumbai, but it was also perfect for cooling down my mouth and throat after a long day of eating spicy foods. I tried two different flavors - the original and the saffron. I preferred the original, but my friends loved the saffron.

Now, if you‚Äôre heading off to India to try the street food, I highly recommend you take a dose of Pepto Bismol before breakfast and another before lunch every day so you don‚Äôt get sick from eating foods and spices your body is not used to.

88,Street Food in Malaysia - ULTIMATE MALAYSIAN FOOD in Kuala Lumpur!,/watch?v=u5LYl4DM5c4,2019-06-27 20:49:49,"Thanks to Oh My Media: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgmykbXSQjlEmCdeMWaZi1A

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you‚Äôll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It‚Äôs a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I‚Äôm a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

If you're thinking about traveling to Bangladesh, DO IT! The street food in Dhaka and the street food in Bangladesh is some of the best in the world. We had the best time creating these food videos for you in Bangladesh and found everyone to be SUPER FRIENDLY! This Dhaka Food Tour video is full of AMAZING street food that you're going to love, it's gonna make you want to move to Bangladesh!

First up, we're going for a Bangladeshi street food BREAKFAST in Old Dhaka, one of the best Chicken soups I've ever tasted, and a SPICY Dal curry that is full of energy! Here, you can get amazing naan bread and spicy curry for breakfast with all the locals for SUPER CHEAP. My breakfast cost less than 1$! AMAZING!

After that amazing street food breakfast in Old Dhaka, we are going for our second Bengali breakfast, with a little more dahl, mixed vegetables, and a semolina pudding in the back streets of Old Dhaka.

After this, we're going to my buddy Shimon's home for a HUGE Bengali HOME COOKED meal with his family! It was SO amazing! I am  now fully convinced that Bengali cuisine is some of the best in the world! We had a ton of spicy curry, delicious ilish fish, one of the most famous seafoods to try in Bangladesh, and some Bangladeshi bhorta plates made with  home style recipes! It was a HUGE Bengali lunch feast. What was even more impressive while making this food video was the amazing hospitality of all the people we met in Bangladesh. Everyone was so friendly and of course so proud of their delicious Bangladeshi food.

I love making these food travel videos for you and it's because of being able to share these amazing street foods around the world and meeting friendly people that I do it. In Dhaka, we found everyone to be extremely friendly and interested in our food travel videos because everyone in Bangladesh loves food!

After the amazing home cooked Bangladeshi food meal with Shimon, we're continuing on our full on food tour of Dhaka and exploring the outskirts of town to try a HUGE SEAFOOD BBQ stall at a local village market quite like a farmers market. This stall had a big variety of local seafood from Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a beautiful country full of delicious seafood and this stall had quite a big selection. They had red snapper, coral fish, local crabs, chicken tikka, and tandoori chicken, all put on top of the BBQ. I found the smoky flavour from the barbecue and the rich curry sauce on top of the fish we ordered to be the PERFECT flavour!

After this amazing local seafood at the farmers market, we continued our food tour and made our way deeper into the market to find a long alleyway PACKED with Bengali dessert shops. This was one of the most AMAZING dessert streets I've ever witnessed! So many varieties of Bengali desserts to choose from!

65,Dubai Food - RARE Camel Platter - WHOLE Camel w/ Rice + Eggs - Traditional Emirati Cuisine in UAE!,/watch?v=1fVwoquZuU4,2018-08-13 16:54:45,"Dubai Food is incredibly delicious! We visited Dubai in the UAE to try some traditional Emirati Cuisine, and joined up with our friend Peyman to eat a whole camel platter with rice and eggs!

‚ñ∫Check out Peyman's Channel Here: http://bit.ly/PeymanSubscribe

This is a traditional Emirati meal that is usually reserved for special occasions or very exclusive guests. It's not a normal Dubai Street Food, but that's why it's so good. It is an extremely rare Arab food nowadays! You have to be incredibly lucky to experience this whole camel platter! This is definitely one of the must try foods in Dubai! It is a traditional Emirati food and is one of the best things to do in Dubai. Camel meat is something that may be sensitive to some viewers, so make sure you're comfortable with watching the camel cooking! The chefs who prepared the camel recipe were originally from the South of India in Kerala, but have been living in Dubai for over 20 years.

If you're thinking of traveling to Dubai for a food trip, you can't go wrong, there is so much delicious Emirati cuisine and amazing street food to try! I must admit, most of the food is in Dubai restaurants that are clean and quiet, but that is part of the charm of Dubai.

First, Peyman and I checked out the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, and then made our way to the one and only Camel Restaurant, address below:

Entire Camel Platter in Dubai: Zaman Awal Restaurant
Address: Al Boom Village, Dubai, UAE, United Arab Emirates

If you're wondering if you should eat street food in Dubai or go for regular restaurants in Dubai, I recommend mixing it up and going for both. In this food video, we are solely visiting one of the best restaurants in dubai for the whole camel plate.

46,The Best Tanzanian Food I Have Ever Eaten at Grace Shop,/watch?v=_kOQCe6iJac,2017-02-16 12:46:35,"For incredible home cooked Tanzanian food in Dar Es Salaam, you should go to Grace Shop. Details here http://migrationology.com/2013/12/grace-home-style-tanzanian-food-one-of-the-best-lunches-you-can-eat-in-dar-es-salaam/

While I was in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, I was able to eat at quite a few local restaurants, some of them good, while others weren't the best. On one of my last days in the city, I got tipped by a friend to eat at a small local restaurants known simply as Grace Shop. It wasn't even much of a restaurant, but more of a small kiosk located in the spread out neighborhood of Oysterbay, just barely onto the Peninsula. I normally would never come to this area looking for good Tanzanian food as it's sort of an expat area, but I sure was surprised this time.

So Grace Shop is a located in a Pepsi painted little kiosk, and at first when I walked up, I didn't even known if I had come to the right place - one reason was because I saw a bunch of wedding gowns in the store window. But I peeked my head inside, and sure enough, there were tables set up and the food was about to be ready to be served. Who would have known that a wedding gown rental store could serve such good Tanzanian food? The restaurant is pretty small, housing only a few tables on the inside and a couple of tables outside. For the lighting, I chose to sit outside and enjoy the cool outdoor breeze, with what would soon by one of the best Tanzanian food meals I've ever enjoyed in my life.

When we arrived, the food wasn't quite ready for lunch, I my anticipation grew as we waited. It didn't take more than a few minutes before I noticed a wheelbarrow pulling up to the back of the restaurant. This was something new for me... being served out of a wheelbarrow - and Tanzanian street food! The food is actually cooked in the house behind Grace Shop, and then it's transported to the little restaurants front to be sold. When the food was ready, it was all unloaded into the back little kitchen room and ready to be served. Everyday for lunch, there are numerous Tanzanian food dishes all laid out and you can pick and choose whatever looks the best. I wanted to eat everything, but of course I had to make up my mind and pick a few things.

I began this Tanzanian food meal with a big scoop of beef pilau, which was rice cooked with huge chunks of beef and oil. Then I chose a deep fried salted fish. From there, the servers piled on all the side dishes like vegetables and beans and sauces, and all sorts of other delicious items. My plate of Tanzanian food was colorful and smelled so amazing I could hardly wait. It was definitely one of the best, if not the best Tanzanian food, home-cooked, meal I've ever had in my life. Everything was spiced and salted to perfection. The rice was oily and had a hint of cinnamon, the fish was salty and crispy, the beans were hearty, and the fresh veggies were fresh and full of flavor. Even the chili was banging hot! Sometimes Tanzanian food can be good, and other times not so good, but this was one of the best Tanzanian food lunches I've ever eaten!

How to get to Grace Shop, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania:

Grace Shop is located in the Oyster Bay part of Dar Es Salaam, just behind the Kenya High Commission. From Ali Hassan Mwinyi, turn onto Kaunda Drive, make your first left (it's Bongoyo Road), and Grace Shop is about 200 meters up the road on your right hand side.

Open hours -- Eat there for lunch, food should be ready around noon
Price -- 5,000 TZS ($3) for my monster plate of food that included both beef and fish, other plates can cost just 3,000 TZS ($1.82)

84,"Food Tour of Peshawar | Mutton Chanp , Rosh at Ghanta Ghar & Karkhano | Pakistani Street Food",/watch?v=fkv6PxH89JQ,2017-01-02 20:47:04,"Peshawar is the capital of the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Situated in the broad Valley of Peshawar near the eastern end of the historic Khyber Pass, close to the border with Afghanistan, Peshawar's recorded history dates back to at least 539 BCE, making it the oldest city in Pakistan and one of the oldest cities in the world

Islamia College Peshawar is a reputable academic institution, the Victorian architecture and green premises is open for the visitors and the sketch of this building is also placed on 1000 Pakistani Rupee note which actually enhances its importance.

Khayber Pass, a mountain pass in north Pakistan. Close to the border of Afghanistan. It also has been the gateway of South Asia ( part of the ancient silk route). It connects the Afghan territories via torkham. Security is the main concern out there currently.

The clock tower is commonly known as ‚Äúghanta ghar‚Äù located at chowk yaadgar at a distance from the city‚Äôs busy centre. It was inaugurated in 1900 in honour to celebrate the diamond jubilee of British queen Victoria.

The most important part of Peshawar‚Äôs local food is meat which is cooked in form ‚Äútikka‚Äù, ‚Äú karhai‚Äù ‚Äúdumpukht‚Äù etc. The people there are fond of lamb meat. The way to order it at any eatery is select the variety and amount of meat, and they cook it in your presence.

- You do not have to be rich to travel -

American and Thai travel couple left the career in military and finance to become travel story teller, proving the world that you don't have to be rich to travel well. We met in 2015 in South Korea While working and studying there.

In 2017, September, we both kicked off traveling with $4000 in our saving account and first started creating 'divertliving' as a mean to :

‚òº show you the world as the way it is - no sugar coated stuff, no hidden truth.
‚òº provide you traveling tips as we consider ourselves as 'careful budget traveling couple' :)
‚òº let you see our struggle and challenge we have been through while traveling and 'trying' to live digital nomad lifestyle as a mixed couple.
‚òº give you positive vibe! as we are like that, we are positive couple :)

We're stoked to take you along our journey and we do appreciate having your support here

Welcome to the final episode of our TURKISH STREET FOOD series. What a way to end it. The WORLD‚ÄôS BIGGEST D√ñNER KEBAB! Starting with MENEMEN for breakfast, a visit at the Dolmabah√ße Sarayi palace to learn about the Ottoman Empire, eating the most massive d√∂ner kebab, a delicious snack of gozleme (Turkish flatbread), a Turkish favourite - rice stuffed mussels, Turkish coffee at an infamous coffeeshop, and an interesting dinner of kokore√ß (highly requested).

We were absolutely thrilled with the various street foods and local cuisine we found in Istanbul, and we were very impressed with the warm hospitality of Turkish locals. It inspired us to return and explore more cities, more food and meet more people. We are already in the works of planning our return. Thank you Turkey so much, we can‚Äôt wait to see you again!

¬ª THE SEAFOOD

1. DOMANNAKA: Mackerel Sashimi + Uni (Sea Urchin) + Dancing Tiger Shrimp
ADDRESS: 101-0025 Tokyo, Chiyoda, Kanda Sakumacho 3-37-4
OPEN: 4PM - 12AM

ü¶ê Domannaka is based in Hokkaido, Tokyo, with 6 locations across the city. They are known for their unique dishes, primarily seafood served while it is still alive. They offer delicacies such as squid, mackerel and trevally. We tried their living mackerel sashimi, uni (sea urchin) and dancing tiger shrimp.

üí∏PRICE: Mackerel (saba) 8.59 USD/6,980 JPY for whole fish | Uni (sea urchin) USD/2,500 JPY per plate (13-20 sea urchins) | Tiger Shrimp (odorigui) USD/890 JPY per shrimp
----
2. TAKAMARU FRESH FISH STORE: Oyster + Ankimo (Monkfish Liver) + Anko Nabe (Monkfish Hotpot) + Deep Fried Monkfish
ADDRESS: 950-1 Oshimata | Seven Park Ario KAshiwa 1F, Kashiwa 277-0922, Chiba Prefecture
OPEN: 11AM - 9PM

üêüTakamaru Fresh Fish Store serves some of Tokyo‚Äôs finest fish delicacies. Among their delicacies is monkfish, a very rare fish that is hard to find in Tokyo, even in big fish markets. Monkfish liver (ankimo) is typically considered the tastiest part of the fish and was even listed on CNN‚Äôs 2011 list of the World‚Äôs 50 Most Delicious Foods. We were fortunate enough to get a taste of this dish, which is not a typical menu item at Takamaru Fresh Fish Store. Monkfish hotpot is a bit more common than monkfish liver, frequently eaten during the winter months in Japan.

43,Singapore Airlines BUSINESS CLASS Food Review! San Francisco to Singapore 17 HOUR Flight,/watch?v=QlQflVOlg0Q,2015-04-03 00:00:30,"Singapore Airlines asked me to try out their business class ultra long range flight. It's the first time ever nonstop flight from San Francisco to Singapore. But before boarding the plane, I stopped by the lounge area, and they make a delicious darn good burger! And you can order as much food as you want! On my flight to Singapore, there were a lot of great meal choices to choose from, and the food was pretty good for airplane foods.

It is most commonly triggered by specific acoustic, visual and digital media stimuli, and less commonly by intentional attentional control. Also known as ""brain massage"", ""head tingle"", and ""brain tingle‚Äù.

15,Japanese Street Food - LIVE FUGU PUFFERFISH Puffer Fish Japan,/watch?v=4xD3wfp1LAA,2015-10-16 03:05:55,"Fugu (Ê≤≥Ë±ö or È∞í; „Éï„Ç∞) is the Japanese word for pufferfish and the dish prepared from it, normally species of genus Takifugu, Lagocephalus, or Sphoeroides, or porcupinefish of the genus Diodon. Fugu can be lethally poisonous due to its tetrodotoxin; therefore, it must be carefully prepared to remove toxic parts and to avoid contaminating the meat.

The restaurant preparation of fugu is strictly controlled by law in Japan and several other countries, and only chefs who have qualified after three or more years of rigorous training are allowed to prepare the fish. Domestic preparation occasionally leads to accidental death.

Fugu is served as sashimi and chirinabe. Some consider the liver to be the tastiest part, but it is also the most poisonous, and serving this organ in restaurants was banned in Japan in 1984. Fugu has become one of the most celebrated and notorious dishes in Japanese cuisine.

Bangkok is one of the best cities in the world for street food, and in Thai extreme Thai street food tour, I met up with my friends Khun Tan (https://www.instagram.com/itan/) and Khun Tape (https://www.instagram.com/pongtap_lunlaman/), who are food lovers and Thai food experts.

We went on an ultimate night street food tour, starting with a tuk-tuk, which I didn‚Äôt even know we were going to do from the beginning. It was a thrilling night, so much Thai food, and so much fun.

Later in the night we also met up with Chef Ton from Le Du: https://www.instagram.com/cheftonn/ when we ate the extreme Mama instant noodles at Jay Oh.

Here are all the restaurants we ate at:

2,15 Foods That Reduce Your Heart Attack Risk by 80%,/watch?v=TKyY5zhrlfQ,2019-03-31 10:26:11,"Do you want to clean your blood vessels? How to decrease the risk of heart attacks in the future? Are you ready to improve your overall well-being? Here are 15 food products that can take care of your heart and prevent heart diseases.

Our heart is one of the most important organs, but, surprisingly, we take care of it the least, loading it every day with stress and unhealthy diets. And that's too bad because fatty food increases cholesterol levels, which leads to vascular plaques that prevent the heart from working correctly. In this video, you will get familiar with 15 products that perform all these activities! Some of them might surprise you with their health benefits!
Watch till the end - as a bonus, you will find a recipe for a special drink for healthy blood vessels. And remember to press the like button in appreciation of our work!

TIMESTAMPS
Fatty fish 1:05
Oatmeal 1:51
Berries 2:30
Dark chocolate 3:19
Nuts 4:00
Extra virgin olive oil 4:45
Red wine 5:23
Green tea 5:53
Broccoli and spinach 6:35
Avocado 7:39
Pomegranate 8:13
Cinnamon 8:43
Watermelon 9:14
Garlic 9:43
Apples and pears 10:28

SUMMARY
- Salmon, mackerel, herring, haddock, and other fatty fish decrease the risk of arrhythmia and atherosclerosis. They also contain lots of vitamins as well as minerals.
- Rich in fiber, porridge decreases the levels of ""bad"" cholesterol and improves digestion. Coarse oatmeal is the healthiest.
- Blueberries and strawberries are very good at lowering blood pressure and dilating blood vessels. Strawberry-lovers also get fiber, folate, antioxidants, and potassium from their favorite berries.
- Dark chocolate provides the anti-stress effect as it increases the production of serotonin which is known for its calming effect. Cocoa, the main component of dark chocolate, also helps to prevent memory decline.
- Nuts contain protein fibers that are useful for the heart. They also have vitamin E as their ingredient which helps to decrease the levels of ""bad"" cholesterol.
- Olive oil is very high in oleic acid which reduces blood pressure. It is interesting that when the olives are crashed, oil leaves them naturally; therefore, beneficial ingredients and vitamins are not harmed by chemicals or preservatives.
- French scientists have also found out that red wine contains some elements which can prolong a human lifespan for about 60 percent! Saying this, it still should be consumed in moderation.
- Green tea makes the brain function better. This drink may decrease the risk of different types of cancer (such as prostate and breast cancer).
- Broccoli, in particular, has a lot of medicinal benefits, such as prevention of some kinds of cancer, digestive system improvement, detoxification of the body. It also resembles a vitamin injection, filling you with numerous vitamins and minerals.
- Avocados are packed with fiber, which can be useful for weight loss, blood sugar reduction, and other health-benefitting processes.
- Pomegranates contain antioxidants, lower blood pressure, normalize blood circulation and increase hemoglobin levels.
- Cinnamon can protect you from heart diseases and atherosclerosis. It also boosts metabolism and helps you to lose weight.
- Watermelon plays an important role in vascular health. It stabilizes the cholesterol levels and contains antioxidants. It provides hydration, which is a great thing for your body.
- Garlic dilates the vessels, lowers blood pressure, alleviates vasoconstriction, and prevents atherosclerotic plaques from appearing. It improves digestion as well, assisting in the functioning of the intestines.
- Apples and pears are rich in fiber that helps your heart. They normalize blood circulation and are cheaper and more readily available alternatives to pomegranates. Besides, apples will help to maintain white and healthy teeth.

In one day, we had 7 delicious street foods all made in the PUNJAB style. I didn‚Äôt realize until after we finished eating, but we didn‚Äôt eat any meat or chicken at all! It was true vegetarian HEAVEN!

We started out the day with an AMAZING Indian breakfast in two different Indian street food restaurants. The first was the famous Amritsar Kulcha. I‚Äôm pretty sure you can get this dish in Delhi, but here in Amritsar is the origin of this stuffed baked bread from HEAVEN. It‚Äôs stuffed with a spiced potato mix and onions. It‚Äôs sprinkled with a masala spice and then put DEEP into the Tandoori oven and baked. It‚Äôs served to you on a plate with Chole chickpea curry and onion chutney.

The next AMAZING Breakfast we had on our street food tour was the Poori and Chole with Potato sabzi. A little similar with the chole, but the potato sabzi was nice and sweet and tangy and very UNIQUE!

Afterwards, we took our TUK TUK around town for some more amazing street foods.  We enjoyed a street corner tofu curry served with a pancake and then we went to have a sweet and sour buttermilk lassi.

After this, we went to the LEGENDARY Kesar De Dhaba all vegetarian curry restaurant that uses PURE desi ghee. It was extremely flavourful and just a little spicy. We ordered the VEG thali and it was incredible! The paratha bread was so fluffy and covered in pure desi ghee, absolute HEAVEN! We also ate some dessert, a fruit kulfi ice cream!

After this we went for a couple more street foods in Amritsar. We were exploring the back lanes and found an amazing mango fruit stall! It was dried and covered in a slightly spicy and sour and tangy sauce. There were a lot of flavours in this Indian recipe. It was spicy, sour, tangy, sweet, peppery, acidic, pungent, and made your mouth pucker when you ate it! Very UNIQUE!

After this, we went for our final street food, an ICONIC street food in India, the samosa. It was stuffed with potato, cumin seeds, and spices.

The addresses for these street food restaurants in Amritsar, India, are listed below:

1) Breakfast Street Food Kulcha at Monu Kulcha Hut
Gali No, 10, Loharka Road, Ranjit Vihar, N.R.I. Colony, NRI Colony, Gumtala, Amritsar, Punjab 143001, India
2) Amazing Poori and Chole and desserts at Kanha Sweets
Shop 1, Opposite Bijli Pehalwan Mandir, Lawrence Road, White Avenue, Amritsar
3) Fairly OK veg curry DEEP in the back lanes of Amritsar (honestly can‚Äôt remember this address, go for the Kesar De Dhaba instead).
4) Delicious Street Lassi at Ahuja Lassi
Near Hindu College, Amritsar, India
5) BEST Vegetarian Curry in the WORLD @ Kesar De Dhaba, Amritsar
6) Amazing Mango sour and spicy dessert at Aam Papad:
Ram lubhaya and sons
7) Potato Samosa at Raam samosey wala
